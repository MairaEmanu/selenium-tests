# Selenium Login Test Automation (Python)

This is a test automation project written in Python using Selenium WebDriver and PyTest.

The goal of this project is to automate a login flow on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) using the Page Object Model (POM) structure.  
It is part of my personal learning plan to become a Test Automation Engineer.
